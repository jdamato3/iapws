Dependences
===========

* python 2x, 3x, compatible with both versions
* Numpy-scipy: library with mathematic and scientific tools


Installation
============

In debian you can find in official repositories in jessie, testing and sid. In ubuntu it's in official repositories from ubuntu saucy (13.10). In other system you can install using pip::

	pip install iapws
